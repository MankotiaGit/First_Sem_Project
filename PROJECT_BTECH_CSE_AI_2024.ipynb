Prompts can contain questions, instructions, contextual information, examples, and partial input for the model to complete or continue. After the model receives a prompt, depending on the type of model being used, it can generate text, embeddings, code, images, videos, music, and more."

He stared out the window of his bedroom, the swirling leaves a blurry spectacle mirroring the chaotic mess inside him.  His room, usually a haven of haphazardly stacked LEGO creations and half-finished drawings, felt like a prison cell, the walls closing in on him with each passing minute.\n",

The laughter of his classmates, once a source of joy, now grated on his nerves, sounding hollow and distant, like a radio playing from another room.  He’d lost interest in the things he once loved: the intricate worlds he built from LEGO, the vibrant characters he sketched, even the video games that used to consume his evenings now felt dull and lifeless.\n",

He felt like he was constantly performing, wearing a mask of normalcy for everyone else, while his true self, bruised and battered, withered away in the shadows.\n",

He couldn't explain it, couldn't articulate the profound emptiness that gnawed at him.  How could he explain the feeling of being trapped inside himself, a silent scream echoing in an empty room?\n",
            "\n",

He dropped the pencil, the graphite leaving a dark smudge on the page, a stark contrast to the fading light outside.\n",

The grey light deepened, the shadows lengthening, and Leo, trapped in his own silent world, felt the weight of his unseen battle crushing him.\n",
